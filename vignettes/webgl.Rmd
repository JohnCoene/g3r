```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)

library(g3r)
library(htmltools)
```

Works as an htmlwidget simply call the `g3r` function.

```{r}
library(g3r)

# grand canyon
g3r(lat = 36.2058, lon = -112.4413, alpha = TRUE) %>% g3r_camera(.5,.5,1)
```

You can run a demo with:

```r
g3r::g3r_demo()
```

## Points

You can add points to map with `g3r_points`, below we plot the 4 base camps that lead to mount Everest: it's a built-in "dataset". Note that the elevation must be in meters.

```{r}
g3r(27.985655, 86.903697) %>% 
  g3r_points(everest, lat, lon, ele)
```
